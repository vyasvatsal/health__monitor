# AI Health Laravel SDK Setup Guide

Welcome to the **AI Health Laravel SDK**. This SDK integrates seamlessly into your Laravel application to provide powerful error detection, background health analysis, Web/Real User Monitoring (RUM), and Conversion/CTA tracking. 

This guide covers the all-in-one setup.

---

## 1. Installation

Because the SDK is currently in private development, you need to add our repository to your `composer.json` before installing:

```bash
composer config repositories.aihealth vcs https://github.com/vyasvatsal/aihealth-laravel-sdk.git
composer require aihealth/laravel-monitor
```

---

## 2. Configuration & Initialization

Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=aihealth-config
```

In your project's `.env` file, add your DSN (Data Source Name) provided by the Health Monitor dashboard. 

```env
# Backend API Key (DSN) - Contains your Public Key, Host URL, and Project ID
# Format: http://{public_key}@{host}/{project_id}
AIHEALTH_DSN="http://your_public_key@127.0.0.1:8000/1"

# Frontend Private Tracking Key (Required for RUM & CTA Analytics)
AIHEALTH_PRIVATE_TRACKING_KEY="rum_your_private_key_here"

# Enable/Disable modules
AIHEALTH_SEND_EXCEPTIONS=true
AIHEALTH_SEND_LOGS=true
AIHEALTH_SEND_TRANSACTIONS=true
```

---

## 3. Module 1: Error & Log Detection

By simply setting the `AIHEALTH_DSN`, the SDK auto-discovers and intercepts exceptions and log messages (using Laravel's built-in handlers). You don't need to change your `bootstrap/app.php` or `Handler.php`! 

The `AIHealthServiceProvider` automatically binds the `ErrorHandler` and `LogHandler` to Laravel's logging channels.

*Tip: To test if errors are being sent, you can trigger a manual exception in a route:*
```php
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first SDK error!');
});
```

---

## 4. Module 2: Background Health Analysis

The Health Analysis module monitors CPU load, Memory limits, and Database connectivity. 

The SDK automatically registers a background heartbeat that runs every five minutes. The only requirement is that your server must have Laravel's base CRON scheduler running.

Make sure your server is running the standard Laravel cron job (normally set up once per server):
`* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

---

## 5. Module 3: Web Analysis (RUM) & CTA Tracking

Real User Monitoring tracks page load speeds, core web vitals, user sessions, and interactions (such as Call-To-Action clicks).

To enable this, add the following Blade directive to your main layout file (`resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`), right before the closing `</head>` tag:

```blade
    <!-- AIHealth RUM & Interaction Tracker -->
    @aihealth
</head>
```

*(Note: Ensure `AIHEALTH_PRIVATE_TRACKING_KEY` and `AIHEALTH_RUM_ENDPOINT` are correctly filled in your `config/aihealth.php` or `.env` file, though the SDK auto-fetches them from the monitor if configured correctly via DSN).*

### Automatic CTA Tracking

The RUM script automatically finds clickable elements and tracks user flows. To explicitly tag critical buttons (like "Checkout" or "Sign Up") for enhanced conversion tracking, add the `data-aihealth-cta` attribute to your HTML elements:

```html
<button data-aihealth-cta="primary-checkout-btn" class="btn-checkout">
    Complete Purchase
</button>

<a href="/pricing" data-aihealth-cta="view-pricing-link">
    View Pricing
</a>
```

## 6. Module 4: Route Synchronization (Web Crawler)

To enable the Health Monitor to automatically crawl your pages and discover conversion/CTA flows, you need to synchronize your application's routes to the dashboard. 

Run the following command once, or whenever you add new frontend-facing routes:

```bash
php artisan aihealth:sync-routes
```

## Troubleshooting

### SSL Certificate Error (cURL error 60)
If you see an error like `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`, it means your local environment (like XAMPP or Laragon) isn't configured with a trusted root CA. 

To bypass this for **local development ONLY**, add this to your `.env`:

```env
AIHEALTH_VERIFY_SSL=false
```

### "There are no commands defined in the aihealth namespace"
If you've installed the SDK but cannot run the `php artisan aihealth:*` commands, try clearing your artisan cache:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan package:discover
```

---

## Summary

With these simple steps, your Laravel application is fully instrumented:
1. **Composer Require & .env API Keys** (Activates the SDK, Error Tracking, Logs, Transactions, and Background Health Monitor)
2. **`@aihealth` Blade Directive** (Activates Web/RUM analysis and Frontend CTA interactions)
3. **Command Execution** (`aihealth:sync-routes` to initialize Web Analysis crawling)
